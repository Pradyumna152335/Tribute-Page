      <h2>Life and Career</h2>
      <p>
        Torvalds was born in Helsinki, Finland, the son of journalists Anna and
        Nils Torvalds, the grandson of statistician Leo TÃ¶rnqvist and of poet
        Ole Torvalds, and the great-grandson of journalist and soldier Toivo
        Karanko. His parents were campus radicals at the University of Helsinki
        in the 1960s. His family belongs to the Swedish-speaking minority in
        Finland. He was named after Linus Pauling, the Nobel Prize-winning
        American chemist, although in the book Rebel Code: Linux and the Open
        Source Revolution, he is quoted as saying, "I think I was named equally
        for Linus the Peanuts cartoon character", noting that this made him
        "half Nobel Prize-winning chemist and half blanket-carrying cartoon
        character" Torvalds attended the University of Helsinki from 1988 to
        1996, graduating with a master's degree in computer science from the
        NODES research group. His academic career was interrupted after his
        first year of study when he joined the Finnish Navy Nyland Brigade in
        the summer of 1989, selecting the 11-month officer training program to
        fulfill the mandatory military service of Finland. He gained the rank of
        second lieutenant, with the role of an artillery observer. He bought
        computer science professor Andrew Tanenbaum's book Operating Systems:
        Design and Implementation, in which Tanenbaum describes MINIX, an
        educational stripped-down version of Unix. In 1990, Torvalds resumed his
        university studies, and was exposed to Unix for the first time in the
        form of a DEC MicroVAX running ULTRIX. His MSc thesis was titled Linux:
        A Portable Operating System. His interest in computers began with a
        VIC-20 at the age of 11 in 1981. He started programming for it in BASIC,
        then later by directly accessing the 6502 CPU in machine code (he did
        not utilize assembly language). He then purchased a Sinclair QL, which
        he modified extensively, especially its operating system. "Because it
        was so hard to get software for it in Finland", he wrote his own
        assembler and editor "(in addition to Pac-Man graphics libraries)" for
        the QL, and a few games. He wrote a Pac-Man clone, Cool Man. On 5
        January 1991 he purchased an Intel 80386-based clone of IBM PC before
        receiving his MINIX copy, which in turn enabled him to begin work on
        Linux.

              On 23 April 2014, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics
              Engineers named Torvalds as the 2014 recipient of the IEEE
              Computer Society's Computer Pioneer Award. The Computer Pioneer
              Award was established in 1981 by the IEEE Computer Society Board
              of Governors to recognize and honor the vision of those whose
              efforts resulted in the creation and continued vitality of the
              computer industry. The award is presented to outstanding
              individuals whose main contribution to the concepts and
              development of the computer field was made at least 15 years
              earlier.

              rhythm, the name was also meant to honor Linus Torvalds, and Linus
